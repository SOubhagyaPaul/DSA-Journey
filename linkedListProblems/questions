Singly Linked List
1. Write a menu driven program to implement a singly linked list with the following
operations
a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
c. Display the list
d. Perform a linear search on the list
e. Insert an element after a specified element
f. Delete a specified element
g. Count the number of nodes
h. Reverse the list, so that the last element becomes the first, and so on
i. Concatenate two lists
Doubly and Circular Linked List
1. Write a menu driven program to implement a doubly linked list with the following
operations
a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
c. Display the list
2. Write a menu driven program to implement a doubly circular linked list with the
following operations
a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
c. Display the list
Linked List Applications (Implement the Questions by your own Linked List class)
1. Write a program to implement a stack using linked list, such that the operations ‘push’
and ‘pop’ are performed in constant time.
2. Write a program to implement a queue using linked list, such that the operations
‘enqueue’ and ‘dequeue’ are performed in constant time.
3. Write a menu driven program to implement a double ended queue using linked list.
