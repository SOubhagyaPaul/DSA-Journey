Problems on Array
1. Create a Class Search within that implement two Generic method LinearSearch(),
BinarySearch(). Test your program for different data.

2. Create a Class BasicSort within that implement three Generic methods that can implement the
BuubleSort(), SelectionSort(), InsertionSort() that can sort of any type of data.

3. Write a Generic method that computes the Second minimum and Second maximum elements
of an array of type T and returns a pair containing the minimum and maximum value.

4. Write class SparseMatrix to give a compressed storage representation of a sparse matrix and
also find the transpose of the sparse matrix (from the compressed representation).

5. Write a Class CheckTriangular within that implement methods to check whether a matrix is
i) Lower triangular ii) Upper triangular iii) Diagonal iv) Identity v) Tridiagonal.

6. Write a program to find whether a matrix is orthogonal or not. Also find the 1-norm of the
matrix.

7. Create a program with multi-dimensional List to store customer details (customerId,
customerName, customerCity).
This program to search the customer based on the customerName from a given array.
Note: use Binary search and Insertion sort algorithm.
 Create a constructor to initialize size of customer details for five customers.
 Create customer method which takes the array of customer elements (sorted as a
customerName).
 Create a method to getCustomer(customerId) method which will return the customer
details as a List.
 Create a method to sortCustomer() method which will return the array in a sorted
order based on customer city.

8. Write a class Polynomial to perform the following
a. Design a constructer to represent a polynomial (of single variable x).
b. Create a method to addition of polynomials.
c. Create a method to subtraction of polynomials.
d. Create a method to multiply of polynomials.
e. Create a method to find derivative of the polynomial.
